# Modules published:
# - coefficients
# - erf
# - erf_coefficients
# - harness
# - math
# - normal_forward
# - normal_inverse
# - sampling
# - signed_wad

# Verification (2024-12-07):
# - All functions tested against scipy.stats.norm
# - sample_z_from_seed: <0.05% error vs scipy PPF
# - sample_normal_from_seed: exact match for mean when z≈0
# - Cross-validated at 5 probability points across distribution
